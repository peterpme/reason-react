title: What & Why
---

ReasonReact is a safer, simpler way to build [React](https://reactjs.org/) components, in [Reason](http://reasonml.github.io/).

By leveraging the latter's great type system, expressive language features and smooth interoperability with JS, ReasonReact packs ReactJS' features into an API that is:

- Safe and statically typed
- Simple and lean
- Familiar and easy to insert into an existing ReactJS codebase
- Well thought-out (made by the creator of ReactJS himself!)

It is often said that writing ReactJS code feels like "just using JavaScript". The same applies to ReasonReact, but we push it further; writing routing, data management, component composition and components themselves feel like "just using Reason".



What & Why
ReasonReact is a simpler way to build React components in Reason, with type safety at its core.

ReasonReact uses Reason/OCaml's expressive language features, along with smooth
JavaScript interop to provide a UI framework API that is:

- Safe and statically typed (with full type inference).
- Simple and lean.
- Familiar and easy to insert into an existing ReactJS codebase.
- Designed/built by people using Reason and React in large, mission critical production React codebases.

One of ReactJS's strengths is that it uses the programming language's features
themselves to implement framework features. It is often said that ReactJS feels
like an extension of the programming language.  ReasonReact pushes that
philosophy further because the Reason syntax and language features are an even
better match for React programming patterns.  ReasonReact also uses built-in
language features to seamlessly integrate into other UI framework patterns left
unaddressed by ReactJS. Routing, data management, component composition and
components themselves all feel like "just using Reason".
